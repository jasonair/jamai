# Firebase Integration Summary

Complete Firebase authentication and user management system successfully implemented in JamAI.

---

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **Email/Password** authentication with signup, login, password reset
- **Google Sign-In** with native OAuth flow
- **Apple Sign-In** with secure credential handling
- Automatic user account creation on first sign-in
- Session management and auth state persistence

### 👤 User Account Management
- User profiles with display name, email, photo
- 4-tier plan system: **Trial, Free, Premium, Pro**
- Credit-based usage tracking (1 credit ≈ 1000 tokens)
- Monthly credit allocation per plan
- Account activity tracking (last login, creation date)
- Plan expiration handling for trial accounts

### 💳 Credit System
- **Automatic credit deduction** after AI generation
- Token estimation and credit calculation
- **Transaction logging** for full audit trail
- Credit history view in user settings
- Low credit warnings and out-of-credit blocking
- User metadata tracking (messages generated, nodes created)

### ⚙️ Remote Configuration
- **App maintenance mode** with custom messaging
- **Force update** system with version checking
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollouts and kill switches
- Announcement system for in-app messaging
- Real-time config updates via Firestore listeners

### 🎨 User Interface
- **AuthenticationView**: Modern login/signup screen
- **UserSettingsView**: Account management, plan comparison, credit history
- **MaintenanceView**: Blocks app during maintenance
- Integrated into app launch flow with authentication gating
- Account menu item in toolbar

### 🗄️ Database Structure
- **Firestore collections**:
  - `users/`: User accounts and profiles
  - `credit_transactions/`: Usage audit trail
  - `config/`: Remote app configuration
- **Security rules** enforcing user data isolation
- **Real-time listeners** for instant updates

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Create Firebase Project (Required)
```
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Create new project: "JamAI"
3. Add iOS app with your bundle ID
4. Download real GoogleService-Info.plist
5. Replace placeholder file in project root
```

### 2. Enable Authentication (Required)
```
Firebase Console → Authentication
- Enable Email/Password
- Enable Google Sign-In
- Enable Apple Sign-In
```

### 3. Create Firestore Database (Required)
```
Firebase Console → Firestore Database
1. Create database (production mode)
2. Create collections: users, credit_transactions, config
3. Set up security rules (see documentation)
```

### 4. Add Firebase SDK (Required)
```
Xcode → Add Package Dependencies
1. firebase-ios-sdk (FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore, FirebaseCore)
2. GoogleSignIn-iOS (GoogleSignIn)
```

### 5. Configure OAuth (Required for Google/Apple)
```

- Add "Sign in with Apple" capability in Xcode
```

### 6. Test Everything
```
✓ Sign up with email
✓ Sign in with Google
✓ Sign in with Apple
✓ Generate AI response (verify credit deduction)
✓ Check credit transaction in Firestore
✓ Test maintenance mode
✓ Test plan upgrade
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Production
1. **Replace GoogleService-Info.plist** with your actual Firebase config
2. **Test all authentication flows** thoroughly
3. **Verify security rules** in Firestore Rules Playground
4. **Set up Cloud Functions** for monthly credit reset
5. **Enable analytics** for user tracking
6. **Configure backups** for Firestore data
7. **Set up monitoring** and alerts

### Cost Considerations
- **Firestore**: Free tier includes 1GB storage, 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
- **Firebase Auth**: Free for all sign-in methods
- **Google Sign-In**: Free
- **Apple Sign-In**: Free (requires Apple Developer account)
- **Estimated cost** for 1000 users: ~$5-10/month (Firestore + Functions)

### Maintenance
- Monitor Firestore usage in Firebase Console
- Review security rules regularly
- Clean up old transactions periodically
- Update Firebase SDK versions as needed
- Test authentication flows after SDK updates
