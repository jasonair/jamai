# Recent Projects Persistence Fix

## Problem
Recent projects were disappearing intermittently due to several issues:
1. Silent bookmark creation failures using `try?` with `compactMap`
2. Race conditions between load/save operations
3. Security-scoped resource access interfering with validation
4. No integration with macOS system recent documents
5. Missing proper error handling and logging

## Solution

### New Architecture
Created `RecentProjectsManager` - a dedicated singleton manager that:
- Uses proper async/await patterns for persistence
- Implements thread-safe queue-based operations
- Integrates with `NSDocumentController` for OS-level recent items
- Provides better error handling and logging
- Validates projects without interfering with open ones

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Thread Safety**
- Uses dedicated `DispatchQueue` for all file operations
- Async save operations prevent UI blocking
- Proper synchronization between reads and writes

#### 2. **Bookmark Management**
```swift
// Security-scoped bookmarks with proper options
let bookmarkData = try url.bookmarkData(
    options: [.withSecurityScope, .securityScopeAllowOnlyReadAccess],
    includingResourceValuesForKeys: nil,
    relativeTo: nil
)
```

#### 3. **Stale Bookmark Handling**
- Detects stale bookmarks during resolution
- Automatically recreates fresh bookmarks
- Cleans up invalid entries asynchronously

#### 4. **NSDocumentController Integration**
```swift
// Adds to system recent documents for File > Open Recent menu
NSDocumentController.shared.noteNewRecentDocumentURL(normalizedURL)
```

#### 5. **Validation Without Interference**
- Quick existence checks before security-scoped access
- Doesn't start/stop access during validation
- Prevents conflicts with currently open projects

### macOS Best Practices Implemented

#### Persistence
- ✅ Security-scoped bookmarks for sandboxed access
- ✅ UserDefaults for storage with proper synchronization
- ✅ Async operations to prevent UI blocking

#### System Integration
- ✅ NSDocumentController for File > Open Recent menu
- ✅ Clears both custom and system recent items
- ✅ Maximum 10 items (standard macOS limit)

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Proper error logging with context
- ✅ Graceful degradation (continues on partial failures)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of invalid entries

#### User Experience
- ✅ Items persist across app launches
- ✅ Invalid items automatically removed
- ✅ Most recently used items appear first
- ✅ Accessible from both Welcome screen and File menu
- ✅ Stores up to **15 recent projects** (industry standard)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+1 to Cmd+9) for first 9 items
- ✅ Scrollable list in Welcome screen for easy access

## Files Changed

### New Files
- **`JamAI/Utils/RecentProjectsManager.swift`** - Dedicated manager for recent projects

### Modified Files
- **`JamAI/JamAIApp.swift`** - Updated `AppState` to delegate to `RecentProjectsManager`
- **`JamAI/Utils/MainAppCommands.swift`** - Fixed keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+1-9 only)
- **`JamAI/Views/WelcomeView.swift`** - Added scrollable list, shows all 15 items

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Persistence**
   - Open several projects
   - Quit and relaunch app
   - Verify all projects appear in recent list

2. **Invalid Item Handling**
   - Open a project
   - Delete the project file from Finder
   - Relaunch app
   - Verify deleted project is removed from list

3. **System Integration**
   - Open a project
   - Check File > Open Recent menu
   - Verify project appears in system menu

4. **Concurrent Operations**
   - Rapidly open multiple projects
   - Verify list remains consistent
   - Check for duplicate entries

5. **Stale Bookmarks**
   - Move a project to a different location
   - Try to open from recent list
   - Should handle gracefully

## Additional Notes

### Why Not Use NSDocument?
- This is a SwiftUI app without NSDocument architecture
- NSDocumentController still provides system menu integration
- Security-scoped bookmarks required for sandboxed access
- Custom approach provides more control and flexibility

### Bookmark Options Explained
- `.withSecurityScope` - Creates bookmark that persists sandbox permissions
- `.securityScopeAllowOnlyReadAccess` - Read-only access (safer)
- `.withoutUI` - Suppresses any UI during resolution

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add recent projects search/filter
- [ ] Show project metadata (last opened, size)
- [ ] Pin favorite projects
- [ ] Project thumbnails/previews
