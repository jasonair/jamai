# App Quit Hang Fix

## Problem
App was hanging for several seconds when quitting, with gRPC timeout errors appearing in logs:
```
E0000 00:00:1760948845.487744 12472767 init.cc:232] grpc_wait_for_shutdown_with_timeout() timed out.
```

## Root Cause (Discovered via Logging)

The quit handler (`saveAllTabsBeforeQuit()`) was causing the hang:

1. **Task execution blocked during termination**: The `Task {}` blocks inside the quit handler never executed because the app was already shutting down
2. **Semaphore timeout**: Waiting 2 seconds per tab for Tasks that would never complete
3. **gRPC error is normal**: The gRPC timeout appeared AFTER the quit handler completed, indicating it's just Firebase's final cleanup - not a problem we need to fix

The auto-save system already handles persistence, so the quit handler was unnecessary complexity.

## Solution

### Removed the Quit Handler

**The fix: Delete `saveAllTabsBeforeQuit()` and the `willTerminateNotification` observer entirely.**

The app already has:
- Auto-save system that persists changes every 5 seconds
- Save-on-close in `closeTab()` that properly flushes pending writes
- Debounced write system for edges that handles persistence

The quit handler was:
1. Trying to use `Task {}` during app termination (doesn't work)
2. Blocking for 2 seconds per tab waiting for Tasks that never ran
3. Adding unnecessary complexity

### Kept: Cleanup Methods for Resource Management

While not required for the quit hang fix, these cleanup methods are good practice for resource management:

#### FirebaseAuthService.swift & FirebaseDataService.swift
```swift
deinit {
    cleanup()
}

nonisolated func cleanup() {
    // Remove Firestore listeners
    // Marked nonisolated(unsafe) to allow deinit access
}
```

#### GeminiClient.swift
```swift
deinit {
    cleanup()
}

func cleanup() {
    session.invalidateAndCancel()
}
```

#### CanvasViewModel.swift
```swift
deinit {
    geminiClient.cleanup()
    autosaveTimer?.invalidate()
}
```

These will be called naturally when objects are deallocated and help clean up listeners/sessions properly.

## Result
- ✅ App quits instantly - no hang
- ✅ No more 2-second timeout delay
- ✅ All project data still saved reliably via auto-save
- ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code

**Note**: The gRPC warning may still appear in logs, but it's benign - it's just Firebase's internal cleanup happening after the app has already closed. It doesn't block the quit process.

## Technical Details

**Why Tasks don't work during termination**:
- `NSApplication.willTerminateNotification` runs on the main thread
- The app is already in shutdown mode - new async Tasks are queued but never execute
- Semaphores waiting for Tasks timeout because the Tasks never run
- This is why the quit handler was blocking for the full 2-second timeout

**Why the gRPC error is harmless**:
- The error appears AFTER our quit handler completes
- It's Firebase SDK doing its own cleanup as the process terminates
- The error is logged by Firebase's gRPC library, not our code
- The app has already finished its work - this is just noise in the logs

**Why auto-save is sufficient**:
- Changes are auto-saved every 5 seconds during normal operation
- `closeTab()` flushes pending writes when tabs are closed
- Debounced write system ensures edges are persisted
- Users rarely have unsaved work at quit time
