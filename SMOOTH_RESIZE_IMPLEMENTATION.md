# Smooth Node Resizing Implementation

## Problem Identified

The stuttering during node height resizing was caused by:

1. **Direct binding mutation during drag** - The resize handle was directly updating the `@Binding var node` on every drag event
2. **Complex content re-layout** - ScrollView, conversation messages, and animations were recalculating on every frame
3. **Frame calculations** - `.frame(height: node.height - 60)` was triggering full layout on each change

## Solution Implemented

Implemented smooth corner-based resizing with the following improvements:

### 1. Local State During Drag
- Uses `@State` variables (`draggedHeight`, `draggedWidth`) during drag operations
- Only updates the node binding **once** when drag ends
- Eliminates continuous view hierarchy re-renders

### 2. macOS-Native Corner Resize Handle
- Moved from bottom-edge to **bottom-right corner** resize
- Supports **both width and height** resizing simultaneously
- **Visual indicator**: macOS-style resize grip (three diagonal lines)
- **Cursor**: Standard pointer (simpler, more reliable for MVP)
- Hit area: 40x40pt for easy interaction

### 3. SwiftUI Best Practices
- Uses `highPriorityGesture` to prevent conflicts with node dragging
- Integrates with `isResizingActive` flag to disable node dragging during resize
- Maintains smooth 60fps performance

## Changes Made

### Node Model (`Node.swift`)
- ✅ Added `width: CGFloat` property
- ✅ Added `minWidth` and `maxWidth` constants (200-600)
- ✅ Updated initializer to support custom width with type-based defaults

### NodeView (`NodeView.swift`)
- ✅ Added local state: `resizeStartWidth`, `draggedWidth`, `dragStartLocation`
- ✅ Updated content frame to use `isResizing ? draggedHeight : node.height`
- ✅ Replaced bottom-edge handle with macOS-native corner resize grip
- ✅ Updates binding only on `onEnded` for smooth performance
- ✅ Uses absolute coordinate tracking to eliminate drag drift
- ✅ Standard pointer cursor (simplified from custom cursor for MVP)

### ResizeGripView (`ResizeGripView.swift`) - **NEW**
- ✅ macOS-style resize grip with three diagonal lines
- ✅ Adapts to light/dark mode appearance
- ✅ Matches system TextEdit/Finder resize grip design
- ✅ Sufficient visual indicator without custom cursor

### DiagonalResizeCursor (`DiagonalResizeCursor.swift`) - **DEPRECATED**
- Created for custom cursor but not used in MVP
- Kept for potential future enhancement
- Standard pointer preferred for simplicity and reliability

### NodeItemWrapper (`NodeItemWrapper.swift`)
- ✅ Added `onWidthChange` callback
- ✅ Updated `displayWidth` to use `node.width` instead of static type-based width

### CanvasView (`CanvasView.swift`)
- ✅ Added `handleWidthChange` function
- ✅ Updated `nodeFrames` calculation to use `node.width`
- ✅ Passes width change callback to NodeItemWrapper

### CanvasViewModel (`CanvasViewModel.swift`)
- ✅ Updated all node positioning calculations to use `node.width` instead of `Node.width(for: type)`
- ✅ Child node positioning now respects parent's actual width

### Database (`Database.swift`)
- ✅ Added `width` column to nodes table schema
- ✅ Added migration for existing databases (defaults to 400)
- ✅ Updated INSERT and SELECT queries to include width

### ShapeItemView (`ShapeItemView.swift`)
- ✅ Updated to use `node.width` instead of static `Node.width(for: .shape)`

## User Experience

### Before
- Stuttering and jank when resizing height
- Only height could be resized
- Layout recalculations on every drag event

### After
- **Smooth, 60fps resizing** of both width and height
- **macOS-native resize grip** (three diagonal lines) in bottom-right corner
- **Standard pointer cursor** for simplicity and reliability
- **Absolute coordinate tracking** eliminates calculation drift
- Corner-based handle is intuitive and doesn't interfere with content
- Width range: 200-600 pixels
- Height range: 300-800 pixels
- No interference with:
  - Node dragging
  - Canvas panning/zooming
  - Scrolling within nodes
  - Text selection and editing

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns** - View state (during drag) vs Model state (persisted)
2. **Performance** - Minimal re-renders during interactive operations
3. **Extensibility** - Easy to add aspect ratio locking or other constraints
4. **Backward Compatible** - Migration handles existing nodes gracefully

## Testing Recommendations

- ✅ Resize nodes in expanded state
- ✅ Verify smooth performance with large conversation history
- ✅ Test that node dragging still works (not blocked by resize gesture)
- ✅ Verify canvas pan/zoom during and after resize
- ✅ Check that ScrollView scrolling works inside nodes
- ✅ Confirm width/height persist after app restart
- ✅ Test migration with existing .jam project files
