# Implementation Summary - Node Features

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Delete Node Functionality
- Added a **delete button** (trash icon) in the node header
- Clicking the delete button removes the node and all connected edges
- Automatically deselects the node if it was selected
- Full database persistence with undo/redo support

### 2. ✅ Create Child Node with Context Inheritance
- Added a **create child node button** (plus.square.on.square icon) in the node header
- Creates a new node positioned to the right and below the parent
- **Inherits the entire conversation history** from the parent node
- Automatically creates an edge connecting parent to child
- Sets appropriate title and description indicating it's a branch

### 3. ✅ Threaded Conversation History
- Responses now **append to a conversation thread** instead of replacing
- Each node maintains an array of conversation messages (user/assistant pairs)
- Previous prompt/response fields maintained for backwards compatibility
- Conversation history is used for AI context building
- All messages are persisted to the database

### 4. ✅ Markdown Formatting for Responses
- Responses now render with **proper markdown formatting**
- Code blocks, lists, headers, bold, italic, etc. all display correctly
- Uses SwiftUI's native markdown rendering (macOS 12.0+)
- Text is selectable for copy/paste

### 5. ✅ Consistent Node Width
- Nodes now maintain the **same width (400px) when collapsed or expanded**
- Only height changes between collapsed and expanded states
- Provides a cleaner, more predictable UI experience
- Updated constants: `Node.nodeWidth` for consistent width

## Technical Changes

### New Files Created
1. **ConversationMessage.swift** - Model for individual chat messages
2. **MarkdownText.swift** - SwiftUI component for rendering markdown

### Modified Files

#### Node.swift
- Added `conversationJSON` field to store message thread
- Added `conversation` computed property to decode messages
- Added `addMessage()` method for appending to conversation
- Updated constants for consistent width
- Maintains backwards compatibility with `prompt` and `response` fields

#### NodeView.swift
- Added `onDelete` and `onCreateChild` callbacks
- Added delete and create child buttons to header
- Replaced separate prompt/response views with `conversationView`
- Messages display in a thread with proper role labels ("You" / "AI")
- Uses `MarkdownText` for formatting responses
- Updated width to use `Node.nodeWidth`

#### CanvasViewModel.swift
- Added `createChildNode()` method for creating nodes with context
- Updated `createNode()` to support context inheritance
- Modified `generateResponse()` to append messages to conversation
- Updated `buildContext()` to use conversation history when available
- Conversation messages are added for both user prompts and AI responses

#### CanvasView.swift
- Wired up `onDelete` and `onCreateChild` callbacks
- Added `handleDeleteNode()` helper method
- Added `handleCreateChildNode()` helper method
- Updated position calculations to use consistent node width

#### Database.swift
- Added `conversation_json` column to nodes table
- Includes migration logic for existing databases
- Updated `saveNode()` to persist conversation data
- Updated `loadNodes()` to read conversation data with fallback

## Usage

### Deleting a Node
1. Select any node
2. Click the red **trash icon** in the node header
3. Node and all connected edges are removed

### Creating a Child Node
1. Select a parent node
2. Click the green **plus.square.on.square icon** in the node header
3. A new child node appears with inherited conversation context
4. Continue the conversation in the new branch

### Threaded Conversations
1. Expand any node
2. Type a prompt and submit
3. Response appears below previous messages
4. Continue adding prompts - all messages display in order
5. Markdown formatting applies automatically

### Viewing Collapsed Nodes
- Collapsed nodes show the last message from the conversation
- Width remains constant at 400px for all nodes
- Expand to see full conversation thread

## Backwards Compatibility

All changes maintain full backwards compatibility:
- Existing nodes with `prompt`/`response` continue to work
- Empty `conversationJSON` falls back to legacy fields
- Database migration adds new column with safe defaults
- Context building tries conversation first, then falls back to ancestry

## Build Status

✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
✅ All features integrated and tested
✅ Database migration included for existing projects
