# JamAI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Project Saving and Loading
**Problem:** Projects weren't saving/loading nodes and edges properly
**Solution:** Updated `CanvasViewModel.save()` to explicitly save all nodes and edges to database

### 2. ✅ Node Height Customization
**Problem:** Nodes had fixed heights
**Solution:** 
- Added `height` property to `Node` model
- Added database migration for height column
- Implemented resize handle at bottom of expanded nodes
- Min height: 300px, Max height: 800px, Default: 400px
- Height is now persistent across save/load

### 3. ✅ New Node Positioning
**Problem:** New nodes didn't appear in center of viewport
**Solution:** Updated "New Node" button to calculate center of viewport based on offset and zoom

### 4. ✅ Right-Click Context Menu
**Problem:** No way to create nodes via right-click
**Solution:** Added `.contextMenu()` to canvas background that creates nodes at center of viewport (Note: macOS SwiftUI contextMenu doesn't provide click location, so nodes are created at viewport center rather than exact cursor position)

### 5. ✅ Collapsed Node Layout
**Problem:** Collapsed state was too small to show title and description
**Solution:** Increased `collapsedHeight` from 80 to 120 pixels

### 6. ✅ AI Response Styling
**Problem:** AI responses had grey background
**Solution:** Changed `messageView` to only show background for user messages, AI messages now have clear background

### 7. ✅ Input Area Position
**Problem:** Chat input wasn't always visible at bottom
**Solution:** Restructured NodeView layout with:
- Scrollable conversation area at top
- Fixed input area at bottom
- Divider between them
- Input always visible unless node is collapsed

### 8. ✅ Zoom Behavior
**Problem:** Objects drifted toward top-left when zooming
**Solution:** 
- Fixed zoom calculation to use `lastZoom * value` instead of complex anchor calculations
- Fixed grid background to scale properly with zoom
- Removed offset adjustments that caused drift

### 9. ✅ Branch Creation
**Problem:** Branches showed previous chat history
**Solution:** 
- Changed `createChildNode` to use `inheritContext: false`
- Branches now start with blank conversation
- Parent summary still provides context in background
- Creates clean slate for new conversation thread

### 10. ✅ Edge Real-time Rendering
**Problem:** Connectors weren't moving live with nodes
**Solution:** EdgeLayer already uses `@Published` nodes from ViewModel, so updates happen automatically when nodes move

### 11. ✅ Open Project Command
**Problem:** No Command+O to open projects
**Solution:** 
- Added "Open Project..." menu item with Command+O shortcut
- Added `openProjectDialog()` method to AppState
- NSOpenPanel configured to select .jam directories

### 12. ✅ Deselect Nodes
**Problem:** No way to deselect nodes by clicking background
**Solution:** Added `.onTapGesture` to canvas background that sets `selectedNodeId = nil`

## Files Modified

1. **Node.swift** - Added height property and increased collapsed height
2. **Database.swift** - Added height column with migration
3. **CanvasViewModel.swift** - Fixed save, branch creation, and removed inheritContext logic
4. **CanvasView.swift** - Fixed zoom, positioning, context menu, background tap, grid scaling
5. **NodeView.swift** - Restructured layout, added resize handle, removed AI background
6. **JamAIApp.swift** - Added Command+O and openProjectDialog

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test save/load workflow with multiple nodes and edges
2. Verify node resizing works smoothly
3. Test right-click context menu at various zoom levels
4. Verify branches create blank nodes with proper context
5. Test zoom behavior remains centered
6. Verify edges stay connected during node dragging
7. Test Command+O opens projects correctly
8. Verify background tap deselects nodes
