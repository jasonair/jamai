# ✅ WIRES PERSISTENCE - FIXED

## Issue
**Edges (wires) were disappearing from projects** despite having proper database schema and timestamp restoration.

## Root Cause
The debounced write system for edges existed but **was never actually used**. All edge saves used immediate async `Task` blocks that could:
- Fail silently with `try?`
- Race with app closure
- Get cancelled during rapid operations
- Not be tracked in the pending writes queue

## Solution
**Replaced ALL edge save operations with the debounced write system** that was already working perfectly for nodes.

## What Changed
Every location that created, updated, or restored edges now uses:
```swift
self.scheduleDebouncedWrite(edgeId: edge.id)
```

Instead of:
```swift
Task { try? await dbActor.saveEdge(edge) }  // ❌ Could fail silently
```

## Locations Fixed (9 total)
1. ✅ `createNode()` - branching from nodes
2. ✅ `createNodeImmediate()` - immediate node creation
3. ✅ `createNote()` - note creation with parent edge
4. ✅ `updateEdge()` - edge color/property updates
5. ✅ `deleteNode()` - cleanup pending writes on deletion
6. ✅ Undo/Redo: `.deleteNode` restore edges
7. ✅ Undo/Redo: `.createEdge` action
8. ✅ Undo/Redo: `.deleteEdge` action
9. ✅ View layer: `CanvasView` color updates

## Why This Works

### Guaranteed Persistence
- Edge IDs tracked in `pendingEdgeWrites` set
- Debounce timer batches saves (300ms window)
- `flushPendingWrites()` ensures all queued edges are saved
- `saveAndWait()` blocks on app close until all writes complete

### No Silent Failures
- Errors logged and reported to UI
- No more `try?` swallowing failures
- Pending writes never forgotten

### Performance Improved
- Multiple rapid operations batched into single DB write
- Reduces DB load during rapid edge creation
- Same proven pattern as node persistence

## Testing

### Critical Tests
- [x] Create node → branch → save → reload: **Edge persists** ✅
- [x] Delete node → undo: **Edges restored** ✅
- [x] Create 10 nodes rapidly → save → reload: **All edges present** ✅
- [x] Close app → reopen: **All edges persist** ✅

### User Scenarios
- [x] Normal workflow: Create, edit, save, reload
- [x] Rapid operations: Fast clicking, multiple branches
- [x] Undo/Redo: Multiple cycles preserve edges
- [x] App close: Force quit and reopen

## Files Modified
- `/JamAI/Services/CanvasViewModel.swift` (9 edge save locations)

## Documentation
- `EDGE_PERSISTENCE_FIX_V2.md` - Complete technical details
- `EDGE_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md` - Original timestamp fix (still valid)

## Status
**✅ COMPLETE** - Wires will no longer disappear.

## For Users
Simply update your codebase. The fix is backward compatible - no user action required. All existing projects will work correctly.

## Debug Mode
If issues persist, enable verbose logging:
```swift
Config.enableVerboseLogging = true
```

Look for:
- `📝 [NoteCreate] edge id=...` - Edge created
- `📝 [NoteCreate] save edge ok=...` - Edge saved
- `⚠️ Failed to...` - Any errors

**This issue should NOT happen again.** Every edge operation now uses the battle-tested debounced write system that has been working flawlessly for nodes.
