# Edge Color Auto-Update Fix

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Issue

When changing a node's color, the connected wire (edge) colors did not update immediately. The wires only updated their colors after dragging the connected nodes, which was frustrating and made the UI feel unresponsive.

## Root Cause

The edge color update logic was already implemented in `handleColorChange()` in CanvasView.swift (lines 584-589), which:
1. Updated all outgoing edges to match the node's new color
2. Called `viewModel.updateEdge(edge)` for each edge
3. Each `updateEdge()` incremented `positionsVersion`

However, the `EdgeLayer` view was not redrawing despite these updates because:
- SwiftUI was caching the EdgeLayer view
- Even though the edges array changed internally (different colors), SwiftUI didn't detect it as a "meaningful" change
- The `.drawingGroup()` modifier was further optimizing rendering, preventing redraws

## The Fix

### 1. Added `.id()` Modifier to EdgeLayer

**File**: `JamAI/Views/CanvasView.swift` (line 319)

Added `.id(viewModel.positionsVersion)` to force EdgeLayer to recreate whenever edges are updated:

```swift
EdgeLayer(
    edges: visibleEdges,
    frames: nodeFrames
)
.id(viewModel.positionsVersion)  // ✅ Force redraw when positions/edges update
.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)
.compositingGroup()
.scaleEffect(currentZoom, anchor: .topLeading)
.offset(currentOffset)
.drawingGroup(opaque: false, colorMode: .nonLinear)
.allowsHitTesting(false)
```

**Why this works**:
- `updateEdge()` increments `positionsVersion` every time an edge is updated
- SwiftUI's `.id()` modifier forces view recreation when the ID changes
- This guarantees EdgeLayer redraws immediately with the new edge colors

### 2. Improved Edge Update Flow

**File**: `JamAI/Views/CanvasView.swift` (lines 579-595)

Cleaned up the `handleColorChange()` logic:

```swift
private func handleColorChange(_ colorId: String, for nodeId: UUID) {
    guard var node = viewModel.nodes[nodeId] else { return }
    node.color = colorId
    
    // Update all outgoing edges to match the new node color
    let edgeColor = colorId != "none" ? colorId : nil
    let outgoingEdges = viewModel.edges.values.filter { $0.sourceId == nodeId }
    
    // Update edges first (each updateEdge increments positionsVersion)
    for var edge in outgoingEdges {
        edge.color = edgeColor
        viewModel.updateEdge(edge)
    }
    
    // Update the node last
    viewModel.updateNode(node, immediate: true)
}
```

**Improvements**:
- Filter edges once before the loop (more efficient)
- Update edges before the node for cleaner sequencing
- Use `immediate: true` for node update to ensure quick persistence
- Clear comments explain the flow

## How It Works

### Update Flow
1. User changes node color via color picker
2. `handleColorChange()` called with new color
3. All outgoing edges filtered and updated with new color
4. Each `updateEdge()` call:
   - Updates edge in memory
   - Increments `positionsVersion`
   - Queues edge for debounced write
5. EdgeLayer's `.id()` modifier detects `positionsVersion` change
6. EdgeLayer recreates with new edge colors
7. ✅ Wires update immediately on screen

### Why Dragging Fixed It Before
- Dragging nodes calls `moveNode()` which increments `positionsVersion`
- This accidentally triggered EdgeLayer to redraw
- The fix makes it happen automatically on color change

## Testing

### Quick Test (10 seconds)
1. Create 2-3 nodes with edges between them
2. Change a node's color using the color picker
3. ✅ Connected wires should update color **immediately**
4. No need to drag or interact with nodes

### Multi-Edge Test (20 seconds)
1. Create a node with 3-4 child nodes (multiple outgoing edges)
2. Change the parent node's color
3. ✅ **All** outgoing wires should update simultaneously

### Color Variations Test
1. Set node to different colors (blue, green, red, etc.)
2. ✅ Wires update to match each time
3. Set node to "none" (no color)
4. ✅ Wires should revert to default gray color

### Performance Test
1. Create 10+ nodes with many edges
2. Rapidly change node colors
3. ✅ Should remain smooth and responsive
4. No lag or stuttering

## Impact

- ✅ **Immediate visual feedback** - wires update instantly
- ✅ **Better UX** - no need to drag nodes to see changes
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - matches user expectations
- ✅ **No performance cost** - efficient update mechanism
- ✅ **Clean code** - improved logic flow in handleColorChange

## Files Modified

**CanvasView.swift**:
- Line 319: Added `.id(viewModel.positionsVersion)` to EdgeLayer
- Lines 579-595: Improved `handleColorChange()` logic

## Related Systems

This fix leverages existing infrastructure:
- `positionsVersion` - Already used for node position updates
- `updateEdge()` - Already increments positionsVersion
- Edge color inheritance - Already implemented correctly

The fix simply ensures SwiftUI reacts to the changes that were already happening.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Edge colors now update immediately when node colors change.
