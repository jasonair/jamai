# Canvas Clipping Issue - RESOLVED with Shape-Based Rendering

## Solution Implemented

**Status: ‚úÖ FIXED** - Switched from Canvas to Shape-based rendering

Edges now use SwiftUI `Shape` protocol instead of `Canvas`, which completely eliminates the clipping issue.

## Root Cause

SwiftUI's `Canvas` clips drawing operations to its coordinate space:

1. **Canvas Size**: Even with `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)`, the Canvas's internal coordinate space is limited to the viewport size (e.g., 1920x1080)
2. **Drawing Coordinates**: We draw edges in world coordinates (e.g., from x:5000 to x:8000)
3. **Clipping Happens First**: Canvas clips anything outside its bounds BEFORE transforms (`.scaleEffect()`, `.offset()`) are applied
4. **Result**: Edges connecting distant nodes get clipped and don't render

## Previous Failed Attempts

### ‚ùå Attempt 1: Fixed Large Canvas (65536x65536)
- Broke node dragging (hit testing issues)
- Wires completely disappeared  

### ‚ùå Attempt 2: TimelineView at 60fps
- Severe performance degradation
- "Animating backwards in time" errors

### ‚ùå Attempt 3: Dynamic Canvas Sizing
- Broke node dragging completely
- Wires didn't render at all

## Working Solution: Shape-Based Rendering

**Implementation** (`EdgeLayer.swift`):
```swift
// Use Shape protocol instead of Canvas
ForEach(edges, id: \.id) { edge in
    EdgeShape(from: start, to: end, horizontalPreferred: isHorizontal)
        .stroke(color, lineWidth: 2.0)
    EdgeArrowShape(from: start, to: end, horizontalPreferred: isHorizontal)
        .stroke(color, lineWidth: 2.0)
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ SwiftUI Shapes don't have coordinate space clipping like Canvas
- ‚úÖ Shapes render correctly at any coordinate value
- ‚úÖ Transform (`.scaleEffect()`, `.offset()`) applied to entire shape
- ‚úÖ No performance issues (on-demand rendering)
- ‚úÖ Clean, simple implementation

**Performance**:
- Tested with 50+ edges: Smooth performance ‚úÖ
- Edges update when `positionsVersion` changes
- No continuous redrawing (no TimelineView needed)
- Dragging nodes works perfectly ‚úÖ

## How Other Apps Handle This

### Figma
- **Bounded canvas**: ¬±32,768 pixels from origin
- **WebGL rendering**: Low-level graphics API, not SwiftUI Canvas
- **View culling**: Only renders visible objects
- **Different tech stack**: Canvas2D/WebGL, not SwiftUI

### Miro / FigJam
- Similar bounded approach with large limits
- Custom rendering engines
- Not constrained by SwiftUI

## Benefits of Shape-Based Approach

‚úÖ **No coordinate limits**: Edges render correctly at any distance  
‚úÖ **Excellent performance**: On-demand rendering, no 60fps overhead  
‚úÖ **Simple codebase**: Clean Shape implementations  
‚úÖ **Smooth dragging**: Edges update correctly when nodes move  
‚úÖ **Full functionality**: Dragging, selection, everything works  

## Technical Details

**EdgeShape**: Custom Shape that draws the bezier curve
- Implements `path(in rect:)` to create curve path
- Handles both horizontal and vertical routing
- No coordinate space limitations

**EdgeArrowShape**: Custom Shape that draws the arrow head
- Calculates angle from curve control points
- Draws two arrow lines at proper angle
- Matches the curve's endpoint direction

**Rendering Flow**:
1. `ForEach` creates a Shape view for each edge
2. Shapes draw paths in world coordinates
3. Parent view applies `.scaleEffect()` and `.offset()`
4. SwiftUI renders visible portions to screen
5. No clipping occurs because Shapes handle large coordinates correctly

## Files Modified

- `/JamAI/Views/EdgeLayer.swift` - **Changed**: Shape-based edge rendering with `EdgeShape` and `EdgeArrowShape`
- `/JamAI/Views/CanvasView.swift` - Unchanged (transforms work correctly with Shapes)

## Migration Notes

- **No data changes needed**: Edges are still stored the same way
- **Performance improvement**: Shape-based rendering is efficient
- **Coordinate space**: Now unlimited (no practical boundary)
- **Backwards compatible**: Existing projects work without modification

## Conclusion

The clipping issue is **completely resolved** by switching from `Canvas` to `Shape`-based rendering. This is a better solution than Canvas because:

1. No coordinate space limitations
2. Better integration with SwiftUI's transform system
3. Simpler, cleaner code
4. Excellent performance

The app now supports edges at any distance without clipping! üéâ
