## ðŸš§ Remaining Work

### 1. **Update NodeView Call Sites**
The following locations need to pass `projectTeamMembers`:

**File:** `JamAI/Views/NodeView.swift`

**Location 1 (Edit existing member):**
```swift
// Line ~76
modalCoordinator.showTeamMemberModal(
    existingMember: node.teamMember,
    projectTeamMembers: [], // TODO: Get from parent
    onSave: onTeamMemberChange,
    onRemove: { onTeamMemberChange(nil) }
)
```

**Location 2 (Add new member):**
```swift
// Line ~428
modalCoordinator.showTeamMemberModal(
    existingMember: nil,
    projectTeamMembers: [], // TODO: Get from parent
    onSave: onTeamMemberChange,
    onRemove: nil
)
```

### 2. **Implement Project Team Members Collection**
Need to add a function in `CanvasViewModel` or pass through view hierarchy:

```swift
// In CanvasViewModel.swift
func getProjectTeamMembers(excludingNodeId: String? = nil) -> [(nodeName: String, teamMember: TeamMember, role: Role?)] {
    let roleManager = RoleManager.shared
    return nodes
        .filter { node in
            // Exclude current node if specified
            if let excludeId = excludingNodeId, node.id == excludeId {
                return false
            }
            return node.teamMember != nil
        }
        .compactMap { node in
            guard let teamMember = node.teamMember else { return nil }
            let role = roleManager.role(withId: teamMember.roleId)
            return (
                nodeName: node.title.isEmpty ? "Untitled" : node.title,
                teamMember: teamMember,
                role: role
            )
        }
}
```

Then pass this down through:
1. `CanvasView` â†’ `NodeItemWrapper` â†’ `NodeView`
2. Or: Add to `NodeView` as a closure parameter

### 3. **Future: RAG Context Implementation**
When implementing chat context sharing between team members:

**Approach:**
1. Collect conversation histories from all nodes with team members
2. Use vector embeddings to find relevant context
3. Create a context summary before each response
4. Append to system prompt in `TeamMember.assembleSystemPrompt()`

**Suggested Format:**
```swift
// In assembleSystemPrompt()
if !projectContext.isEmpty {
    assembled += "\n\n# Project Context\n"
    assembled += "Other team members on this project:\n"
    for context in projectContext {
        assembled += "- \(context.memberName) from '\(context.nodeName)' discussed: \(context.summary)\n"
    }
}
```

**Files to modify:**
- `CanvasViewModel.swift` - Add context gathering
- `TeamMember.swift` - Accept and use project context
- `GeminiClient.swift` - Potentially add context to requests
